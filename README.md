Advent of Code
==============

This repository is a Ruby project containing my answers to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Usage

- `bin/today` runs the solution for today's puzzle.
- `rake` runs the test suite.
- Pass your Advent of Code session cookie using the `AOC_SESSION` environment variable so that the program can automatically download input data.
