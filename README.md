Advent of Code
==============

This repository is a Ruby project containing my answers to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Usage

- `bin/login` to log into your Advent of Code account and retrieve your session cookie. This will allow the program to automatically download input data.
    _Note that this requires Google Chrome at the moment. You can also manually write your adventofcode.com session cookie in `cache/session`._
- `bin/today` runs the solution for today's puzzle.
- `rake` runs the test suite.
